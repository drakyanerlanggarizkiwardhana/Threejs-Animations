## Deformable body animation

Animation of a cloth by using a particle system that connect a rectangular mesh. The particles are subject to 3 forces: gravity (constant) , wind (Time dependent) , spring (n-ary). The spring structure is composed of Stretch (horizontal / vertical) and Shear ( diagonal ) springs.
Shaders were also used in this animation.
